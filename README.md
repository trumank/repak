# repak

Library and CLI tool for working with Unreal Engine .pak files.

 - Supports reading and writing a wide range of versions
 - Easy to use API while providing low level control:
   - Only parses index initially and reads file data upon request
   - Can rewrite index in place to perform append or delete operations without rewriting entire pak

`repak` CLI
 - Sane handling of mount points: defaults to `../../../` but can be configured via flag
 - 2x faster unpacking over `UnrealPak`
 - Unpacking is guarded against malicious pak that attempt to write to parent directories

## 🔐 VDenuvo Support (This Fork)

This fork adds **full read/write support for VDenuvo encryption** - a custom AES-256 variant used in UE5 games with Denuvo anti-tamper.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Custom 14-round block cipher with non-standard S-boxes
- ✅ Index-only encryption (file data unencrypted)
- ✅ Simple `--denuvo` CLI flag for all operations
- ✅ Verified working in-game (Operation Lovecraft: Fallen Doll - UE 5.5)

**Quick Usage:**
```bash
# Extract VDenuvo PAK
repak --denuvo unpack Pak1.pak output_dir

# Repack with VDenuvo encryption
repak pack --version VDenuvo --compression Zlib \
  --mount-point "../../../Game/" \
  --path-hash-seed 123456789 \
  input_dir Pak1_repacked.pak
```

**📖 Full Documentation:** See [`README_VDENUVO.md`](README_VDENUVO.md) for complete usage guide, troubleshooting, and technical details.

## cli
```console
$ repak --help
Usage: repak [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  info       Print .pak info
  list       List .pak files
  hash-list  List .pak files and the SHA256 of their contents. Useful for finding differences between paks
  unpack     Unpack .pak file
  pack       Pack directory into .pak file
  get        Reads a single file to stdout
  help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -a, --aes-key <AES_KEY>  256 bit AES encryption key as base64 or hex string if the pak is encrypted
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version
```

### packing
```console
$ find mod
mod
mod/assets
mod/assets/AssetA.uasset
mod/assets/AssetA.uexp

$ repak pack -v mod
packing assets/AssetA.uasset
packing assets/AssetA.uexp
Packed 4 files to mod.pak

$ repak list mod.pak
assets/AssetA.uasset
assets/AssetA.uexp
```

### unpacking
```console
$ repak --aes-key 0x12345678 unpack MyEncryptedGame.pak
Unpacked 12345 files to MyEncryptedGame from MyEncryptedGame.pak
```

[^1]: Except for paks compressed using frozen index which has significant
    complexity and only existed for UE 4.25 anyway.
[^2]: As of writing. Later versions are likely supported but untested.
[^3]: Zlib, Gzip, and Zstd are supported. Not all compression algorithms are
    available in all games.

Supports reading encrypted (both index and/or data) and compressed paks.
Writing does not support compression or encryption yet.

## notes

### determinism

As far as I can tell, the index is not necessarily written deterministically by `UnrealPak`. `repak` uses `BTreeMap` in place of `HashMap` to deterministically write the index and *happens* to rewrite the test paks in the same order, but this more likely than not stops happening on larger pak files.

### full directory index

`UnrealPak` includes a directory entry in the full directory index for all parent directories back to the pak root for a given file path regardless of whether those directories contain any files or just other directories. `repak` only includes directories that contain files. So far no functional differences have been observed as a result.
